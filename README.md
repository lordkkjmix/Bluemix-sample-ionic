2. Open <b>app.js</b> located at [your-directory]/www/js/app.js
3. Replace the \<APPLICATION_ROUTE\> and \<APPLICATION_GUID\> with your Bluemix application ID and route.
4. Make sure your route is using **https**

Javascript:

```Javascript	
// Bluemix credentials
route: "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>",
guid: "<APPLICATION_GUID>",
```

***Note: Don't forget commas at the end of each line!***

### Build/Run the ionic App

Now you can run your application in your mobile emulator or on your device.

1. Build the ionic app. (no need if your run)From your terminal enter the following command:

	```Bash
	ionic build ios
	ionic build android
	```

2. Run the sample app. From your terminal enter the following command:

	```Bash
	ionic run ios
	ionic run android		
	```

You will see a single view application with a "PING BLUEMIX" button. When you click this button the application will test the connection from the client to the backend Bluemix application. The application uses the ApplicationRoute specified in **app.js** in order to test the connection. The application will then display if the connection was successful or unsuccessful. In the unsuccessful state an error will be displayed in the Xcode/Android log, as well as in the application.

***Note: A GET request is made to a protected resource on the Node.js runtime on Bluemix. This code has been provided in the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate. If the backend application was not created using the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate the application will not be able to connect successfully.***

### Resolve any problems

Check the following items:

- Verify that you correctly pasted the route and GUID values.
- Check the Xcode or Android debug log for more information.
- Check the status of your App in Bluemix.
***Browser can run cordova plugin and make error "Undefined file"***
